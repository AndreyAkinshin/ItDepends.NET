## Description

The code uses undocumented C# keywords like __makeref, __refvalue. MS.NET supports these keyword. Mono 3 also supports, but does it differently. Mono 2 doesn't support.

## Runs

* **ms** (Windows, MS.NET): Works correctly
* **mono-3** (Linux, Mono 3.10.0): Unhandled Exception
* **mono-2** (Linux, Mono 2.4.4): Compilation failed
